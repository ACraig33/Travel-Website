		  <h1 class="zhangye"> 1. Zhangye Danxia Geopark,China</h1>
			<p class="description_main1"> As an important staging point on the Silk Road, Zhangye linked the eastern and western routes. Zhangye is in central Gansu Province in the narrowest middle of the famous Hexi Corridor. Zhangye is between Wuwei city in the east and Jiayuguan in the west, with Qinghai Province to the south and Inner Mongolia to the north.
Zhangye has become a relatively new tourist destination, popular with photographers and Silk Road travelers.
It’s also a film location recently made famous in China and abroad. You might be impressed by the spectacular landscapes in Disney's live-action movie Mulan, directed by Niki Caro. When Mulan is tearfully facing the sunset, the colorful landform behind Mulan is the beautiful Danxia “rainbow mountains” in Zhangye. </p>
			
			<h2>  Sights </h2>
			<p class="description_geo"> Zhangye contains many impressive monumnets such as the Buddha Temple, the Magnificent Mati Temple Grotto, the Han Dynasty tomb complex, and a few more including the rainbow mountains. The Rainbow Mountains of China within the Zhangye Danxia Landform Geological Park are a geological wonder of the world. These famous Chinese mountains are known for their otherworldly colors that mimic a rainbow painted over the tops of rolling mountains. </p>

		  <h1 class="venice"> 2. Venice, Italy </h1>
<p class="description_main2">Venice is one of Italy’s most picturesque cities.  The romantic city of Venice is located in the Veneto region of Italy — one of the northernmost states. This ancient and historically important city was originally built on 100 small islands in the Adriatic Sea. Instead or roads, Venice relies on a series of waterways and canals.
One of the most famous areas of the city is the world-renowned Grand Canal thoroughfare, which was a major centre of the Renaissance. 
  </p>
			<h2> Sights </h2>
			<p class="description_geo">Few cities can claim such a priceless art and history heritage as Venice. This unique city with its magical, spectacular scenery is not just beautiful; it is a real miracle of creative genius: a city built on mud, sand and the slime of a difficult, inhospitable landscape.
The biggest attraction in the gorgeous city of Venice is the architecture — which is enhanced by the ancient canals that surround it. As well as Piazza San Marco and St. Mark’s Basilica, the city is home to the Gothic masterpiece Doge’s Palace.

		  <h1 class="great_Ocean"> 3. Great Ocrean Road,Australia  </h1>
<p class="description_main2">The spectacular Great Ocean Road hugs the seaside cliffs that snake along the wild and windswept Southern Ocean. The striking vistas along the iconic road evoke awe with craggy cliffs, empty beaches and soaring bluffs flanked by brilliant green countryside. Add epic surf, native wildlife, unforgettable hiking and biking trails and you will find plenty of things to see and do around every corner.

			<h2> Sights</h2>
			<p class="description_geo"> These soaring pillars, which have been chiselled out of limestone over 10 to 20 million years, are the highlight of the Great Ocean Road. Stop at Teddy’s Lookout along the craggy cliffs to admire the famed sea stacks, which tower above the ocean.Enjoy spectacular ocean vistas as you trek through tree-fern gullies and eucalypt woodlands at Wildlife Wonders in the Otways. Walk through the magical setting – designed by an art director on the Hobbit films</p>

		  <h1 class="cherry_blossom"> 4. Japan in Cherry Blossom Season </h1>
<p class="description_main">Every year is different when it comes to the sakura (cherry blossom trees). As springtime begins, the country waits patiently for the first flushes of pink.The earliest sakura appears in tropical Okinawa in January, the last on the northernmost island of Hokkaido in early May. What’s more, there are multiple tree varieties, each blooming at a slightly different time. Early Kawuzu blooms appears from the start of February and last until early March, mostly along the Kawzu River on the Izu Peninsula, southwest of Tokyo. Lake-blooming Omuro cherries appear early to mid-April. For peak pink in the main tourist hot spots, including Tokyo, visit between the end of March and early April, when the ubiquitous Yoshino flowers arrive and last around a week before falling quickly.
	    </p>
			<h2> Sights</h2>
			<p class="description_geo">Usually, the blooms burst into colour between mid-March and early May and kaleidoscopic cherry blossom erupts all over Japan, filling ornamental parks and framing city canals. Although these trees exist around the world, nowhere matches Japan’s annual pandemonium of pink petals. But, if you can’t make full bloom, don’t fret. Plan a trip in February, when the equally beautiful but lesser-known plum blossoms are on show.

		  <h1 class="pitons"> 5. Pitons, St Lucia</h1>
<p class="description_main">Hands down, Saint Lucia is one of the finer vacation destinations in the Caribbean. With plenty of sun, sea, sand, greenery, peace, quiet… and as much excitement as you can fit into your itinerary, you’ll find that these shores are pure magic. 

	    </p>
			<h2> Sights</h2>
			<p class="description_geo">Of all the amazing things to do in Saint Lucia, climbing the Pitons is one of the most popular. These incredible twin peaks are a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a trek to the top of Gros Piton in particular, is a sure way to get your adrenaline going. Book an excursion through your resort or online, it’ll without a doubt be the highlight of your trip.Another unmistakable area is the central square in Venice, called the Piazza San Marco. This is where you’ll find a range of Byzantine mosaics, the Campanile bell and, of course, the stunning St. Mark’s Basilica.
