		  <h1 class="inca"> 1. Inca Trail, Peru</h1>
			<p class="inca">One of the most popular things to do in South America - and one of the world’s most famous hikes - the Inca Trail is the sort of singular adventures for which we all travel. The hike itself, which brings you along ancient narrow paths deep into the Peruvian countryside and high into the Andean mountains, is gorgeous; perfect Incan ruins, cloud forest, and majestic valley views laid out like breadcrumbs along the way to perhaps the greatest end-point of any multi-day hike on earth, the iconic Machu Picchu. </p>
			
			<h2>  Scenery</h2>
			<p class="description_inca"> Only a few hours of hiking on your first day will lead you to the first superb Inca site.  Patallacta (also called Llactapata) sits on the far left bank of the Cusicancha River, a tributary of the river Urubamba.On the morning of the third day on your Inca Trail trek, you’ll huff and puff your way up the Runkurakay Pass. At the top, this pass is 13,000 feet (3,950 meters) above sea level. About halfway up you will come across the Runkurakay ruins. Later on, you will reach Sayacmarca, another impressive site. To enter these ruins, you’ll climb up 98 stone steps carved into the side of the mountain. Also called the “Inaccessible Town".</p>

		  <h1 class="annapurna"> 2. Annapurna Circuit, Nepal </h1>
<p class="description_main2">The Annapurna Circuit, a 12 to 21-day route that begins in the lush green villages of the Himalayan foothills. Taking trekkers over the 5,416m Thorong La Pass and down to the Tibetan-influenced temples and communities of the Mustang Valley.
If you want to experience a little bit of everything Nepal has to offer, this is perhaps the best trek to set off on, but it’s certainly no easy feat. The circuit is very tough at times, and the high altitude and unpredictable weather of the Annapurna mountain range can make crossing the Thorong La Pass a dangerous task – particularly if you’re not prepared.
	   </p>
			<h2> Scenery </h2>
			<p class="description_geo">Hiking Nepal's Annapurna Circuit is one of the most stunningly beautiful, life-changing experiences you can have on your travels, and we're pretty sure that, like us, you'll be absolutely captivated by the area from the very first day. Winding through some of the world's tallest mountains and diverse climatic zones (from tropical to freezing alpine peaks), intensive days spent on your feet, and enjoying the beautiful hospitality of the Nepalese people and their quaint mountain villages: the 16 days you'll spend on the Annapurna Circuit trail are some of the most inspiring and challenging you'll ever encounter, and the arrival back to Pokhara will feel so rewarding

		  <h1 class="kilimanjaro"> 3.Kilimanjaro,Tanzania </h1>
<p class="description_main2">At 5,895 meters (19,341 feet) Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa and the tallest freestanding mountain in the world; it is one of the Seven Summits. The snow-capped peak of Africa is a dormant volcano and can be found inside the Kilimanjaro National Park of Tanzania.

			<h2> Scenery</h2>
			<p class="description_geo">On the Western Approach and Grand Traverse treks, youll arrive for the first time above the forest. You will be able to take in the rolling sky and once ewhen the clouds part that’s when you’ll see Kibo’s snowy peak in the distance.On any part of the trek on a clear night you’ll be able to view spectacular sunset behind Shira Peak, and uninterrupted views of Uhuru Peak. Kilimanjaro also includes landscape similar to a Dr. Seuss book, the Great Barranco Valley is a surreal sight to behold. This is the only place in the world to find the alien-looking giant groundsel plant, a mutated variety of a common weed. In addition to the funky flora, there are crystal clear waterfalls, impressive views of the glaciers shimmering above, and a massive wall that will have you scrambling up the path.

		  <h1 class="everest"> 4. Everest Base Camp, Nepal</h1>
<p class="description_main">Located at the foot of the Khumbu Glacier, Everest Base Camp is encircled by some of the most iconic peaks on Earth. Thousands of trekkers a year hike to Everest Base Camp and along other circuits in Nepal without ascending the peaks. While the peaks are mentioned on the Top 5 mountain lists on the explore page it is notable to mention that, while they may be stunning Everest's peaks pose a great danger to those who attempt the trek unprepared. Hundreds of international mountaineers journey to Mount Everest each spring hoping to make a successful ascent of the world’s highest peak. The vast majority of their time, however, isn’t spent climbing up the flank of the mountain. It’s spent resting, acclimatizing, and preparing at the mountain’s two principle base camps, one on the Nepal side and one on the opposite side of the mountain in Tibet. 
	    </p>
			<h2> Scenery</h2>
			<p class="description_geo">While you can't see Mount Everest from Base Camp – there are other incredibly tall mountains blocking your view. From day one of the hike, you'll have great views of the world's tallest mountain so you'll have lots of snaps of Mount Everest from other parts of the hike.

		  <h1 class="w_Circuit"> 5.W Circuit, Torres Del Paine, Chile</h1>
<p class="description_main">The W Trek in Torres del Paine is undoubtedly one of the best treks in Patagonia. This “W” shaped hiking trail highlights the best of Torres del Paine National Park, including Grey glacier, the French Valley and the Towers’ Base Viewpoint. Here, you will spend up to 8 hours a day hiking in the wild, but with some of the world’s most stunning viewpoints, there is no way you’ll get bored.
And while the surreal beauty of Torres del Paine made it a popular destination amongst hikers Patagonia's finest national park still offers plenty of opportunities to disconnect from civilization and reconnect with wilderness, in landscapes more dramatic than Mordor and Westeros combined.

	    </p>
			<h2> Scenery</h2>
			<p class="description_geo">The W trek in Torres del Paine National park is a stunning route with some of the most beautiful landscapes in Patagonia. The trek is a good compromise between day hikes in Torres del Paine and the challenging O-circuit. The W route takes hikers to all highlights of the National Park including the Mirador Las Torres, Grey Glacier, and Pehoé Lake. In my opinion, the W trek is one of the best hikes in Patagonia. It’s a good combination of a great hiking experience, amazing scenery, good infrastructure, and a moderate level of difficulty.
