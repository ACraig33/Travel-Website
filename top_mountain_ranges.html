			<p class="description_main1"> The Himalayas are considered to be one of the greatest mountain system in Asia and also one of the planet’s youngest mountain ranges, this system extends for more than 2,400km across the nations of Bhutan, China, India, Nepal, and Pakistan. While certain parts are infamously dangerous to traverse without intense training to adjust one's body to the altitude some parts more inland and near local villages are incredibly beautiful and offer amazing sights for nature enthusiasts. </p>
			
			<h2>  Geography</h2>
			<p class="description_geo"> The Himalayas are surrounded by the Tibetan Plateau in the north, the 800km long Hindu Kush and 500km long Karakoram Mountain ranges in the northwest, and by the vast Indo-Gangetic Plains in the south. The mighty Himalayan Mountain Range covers an area of about 595,000 sq. km and its maximum width varies between 150 to 350km. The major portion of the Himalayan Mountain Range is occupied by the countries of Nepal, Bhutan, and India, though some parts of this massive mountain range are also occupied by China as well as by Pakistan. </p>

	    It separates the Mediterranean and Atlantic coastlines from the Sahara Desert. It stretches around 2,500 km (1,600 mi) through Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. The range's highest peak is Toubkal, which is in central Morocco, with an elevation of 4,167 metres (13,671 ft)	The three ranges of the Atlas Mountains create a striking, sometimes harsh barrier between the arid Sahara and Morocco’s milder coastal climate. The middle of these ranges, the High Atlas Mountains, begins close to the Atlantic in Agadir and run in a ja line northeast through the country, encompassing some of the region’s most authentic pockets of culture as well as offering some of its best opportunities for walking.</p>
			<h2> Geography</h2>
			<p class="description_geo">
			The mountains’ broad russet slopes are dotted with scrubby pines and lacy cedars, and the peaks gleam with snow even in the warmer months. Dirt roads and narrow footpaths snake through the otherwise pristine landscape, and in the moist, green valleys you’ll wind past herds of goats, wild herbs and small, remote Berber villages.

<p class="description_main2">At over 4,000 miles in length, the Andes Mountains comprise the longest mountain range in the world. Visitors from around the world travel to the region to experience the dramatic scenery, well-preserved indigenous culture and monuments such as Machu Picchu and San Pedro Apostol. However, there are several potential sources of danger when traveling to the region, so it is best to be informed before you arrive.
	   </p>
			<h2> Geography</h2>
			<p class="description_geo">The range covers about 8,850 kilometers (5,500 miles). Situated on the far western edge of the continent, the Andes stretch from the southern tip to the northernmost coast of South America. There are hundreds of peaks more than 4,500 meters (15,000 feet) tall, many of which are volcanic. 

The highest peak in the Andes, Aconcagua, stands at 6,962 meters (22,841 feet) and straddles the Argentina-Chile border. Aconcagua is the tallest mountain outside Asia. 

High plateaus are also a feature of the Andes. The altiplano of Peru and Bolivia, for example, has an elevation of about 3,700 meters (12,300 feet). The Patagonia region of Argentina and Chile consists of lower-elevation plateaus and rugged glaciers.

<p class="description_main">The Canadian Rockies are famous for pristine nature, excellent infrastructure for road tripping, beautiful blue-green lakes, rushing rivers, deep forests, snow-capped mountains, glaciers, and wildlife.
The area is truly visually mind-blowing, so it does not come as a surprise that this is the bucket list destination every traveler wants to visit at least once in a lifetime.
	    </p>
			<h2> Geography</h2>
			<p class="description_geo">The Canadian Rockies are the easternmost part of the Canadian Cordillera, the collective name for the mountains of Western Canada. They form part of the American Cordillera, an essentially continuous sequence of mountain ranges that runs all the way from Alaska to the very tip of South America.The Rockies vary in width from 110 to 480 kilometres (70 to 300 mi). The Rocky Mountains contain the highest peaks in central North America.

<p class="description_main">
Southern Alps/Kā Tiritiri o te Moana, mountain range on South Island, New Zealand. 
The Alps are the largest mountain range in New Zealand and run the length of the South Island – 500km of rugged mountains from Nelson to Milford Sound. Many of the peaks soar over 3,000 metres high.Encompassing the Southern Alps, this is the highest alpine region in New Zealand with permanent snow and ice fields above the treeline and highly endemic alpine communities.
	    </p>
			<h2> Geography</h2>
			<p class="description_geo">The rugged Southern Alps extend some 650 kilometers (400 miles) along the western side of New Zealand's South Island. The mountains are often obscured by clouds, which is probably why the Maoris called New Zealand "Aotearoa", the long white cloud. The higher peaks are snow-covered all year round.
