		  <h1 class="miguel"> 1. San Miguel de Allende, Mexico</h1>
			<p class="description_main"> People who travel to San Miguel de Allende love it for its seemingly eternal spring. Winter is high season, with clear days and chilly nights; summer is rainy season, with green hills and mild temperatures; fall is fiesta season, boasting tourists, parades, and fireworks. There’s no bad time to go.You can walk everywhere in the Centro as long as you watch your step on the cobblestones. Otherwise, the public buses are cheap (30 cents) and taxis ($1.50 - $2.50) are ubiquitous—notable, since the hills are steep. </p>
			
			<h2> General Overview</h2>
			<p class="description_geo"> While having warm weather and delicious food San Miguel de Allende is also known for its well-preserved (and very photogenic) Colonial and Spanish architecture. ... The tallest building in the city, with a facade of pink limestone, is the Parroquia de San Miguel Archangel. The façade for this local parish church was inspired by Gothic cathedrals in Europe. </p>

		  <h1 class="kyoto"> 2. Kyoto, Japan </h1>
<p class="description_main">Kyoto (京都, Kyōto) served as Japan's capital and the emperor's residence from 794 until 1868. It is one of the country's ten largest cities with a population of 1.5 million people and a modern face.
Over the centuries, Kyoto was destroyed by many wars and fires, but due to its exceptional historic value, the city was dropped from the list of target cities for the atomic bomb and escaped destruction during World War II. Countless temples, shrines and other historically priceless structures survive in the city today. Northeast of the industrial city of Ōsaka and about the same distance from Nara, another ancient centre of Japanese culture. Gently sloping downward from north to south, the city averages 180 feet (55 metres) above sea level. 
  </p>
			
			<h2> Sights </h2>

<p class="description_main"> The city, located about 145 miles (230 km) northwest of Rome, is surrounded by gently rolling hills that are covered with villas and farms, vineyards, and orchards.

The city is noted for its culture, Renaissance art and architecture and monuments. The city also contains numerous museums and art galleries, such as the Uffizi Gallery and the Palazzo Pitti, and still exerts an influence in the fields of art, culture and politics.

Wander some of the oldest streets in the city until you reach the Arno River, cross the Ponte Vecchio, and experience the "newest" area of Florence, the Oltrarno. </p>

		  <h1 class="sebastian"> 5. San Sebastián, Spain</h1>
<p class="description_main">San Sebastián has a justly deserved reputation as one of the world’s great dining destinations. This is a city that celebrates the art of eating well in all its many forms – whether snacking on fresh oysters and txakoli (a lightly sparkling white wine) at a seaside cafe or lingering over a decadent, multi-course feast in a Michelin-starred dining room. Pintxos (Basque tapas) bars litter the streets of San Sebastián, and showcase first-rate ingredients from the surrounding coast and countryside combined with the culinary creativity of Basque chefs. When it comes to cooking, no other city quite compares.

	    </p>
			<h2> Sights</h2>
			<p class="description_geo">Framed by golden beaches and lush hillsides, San Sebastián has undeniable allure, from its venerable dining scene to its grand architecture and packed cultural calendar.Spain’s culinary capital is also blessed with an alluring coastline. The long Playa de la Concha is the city’s great backyard, a picturesque sweep of sandy beach that fronts gently lapping seas. Surfers head one beach over to the powerful waves that roll in off of Playa de la Zurriola, just behind the hipster enclave of Gros. Just offshore of the old town lies Isla de Santa Clara, a small hilly island that makes a fine getaway on a steamy afternoon. The city has some fine vantage points to gaze over its coastline, including the hilltop heights of Monte Urgull and Monte Igueldo.
